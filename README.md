Qdrant collection was created in this project to store vectorized representations of documents. Each document is stored as a point in the collection, with its corresponding vector and metadata (such as the source or content). This enables users to easily manage and search their data based on vector similarity.

The project also enables users to perform similarity-based searches on the stored data. This allows for retrieving related content quickly and accurately by comparing the query vector with the stored vectors in the collection
